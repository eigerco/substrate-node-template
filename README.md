# Substrate Node Template With The Move Pallet Integrated

This repository is just a fork of the _Substrate Node Template_ (from the main branch of this repo), which integrates [pallet-move] inside and should only be used for testing.

Check [pallet-move] if you would like to know more - even the _how-to-run_ instructions are located in that repo.
